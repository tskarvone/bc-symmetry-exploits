# Usage

Clone or download the repository and add `functions` directory to your MATLAB search path. The three numerical experiments of the article are in separate directories.

# Contributors

Most of the code is written by the authors and some parts have been released previously in [https://github.com/tskarvone/fskq](https://github.com/tskarvone/fskq). 

The function `functions/fss.m` is partly based on a MATLAB Central [answer](https://se.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/newsreader/view_thread/164470) by Bruno Luong, `functions/nsumk.m` is by Peter Cotton ([https://se.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/28340-nsumk](https://se.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/28340-nsumk)) and `functions/spgetseq.m` is taken from the [Sparse Grid Interpolation Toolbox](http://www.ians.uni-stuttgart.de/spinterp/) by Andreas Klimke.

The functions in `example_global-illumination/` are based on the code provided to the authors by Ricardo Marques.
